          <h2>About Queens of the Stone Age</h2>
          <p>
            Queens of the Stone Age is a rock band from Palm Desert, California,
            United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although
            they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented,
            heavy music which the band's founder and mastermind Josh Homme
            described as "robot rock", saying that he "wanted to create a heavy
            sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head". Since
            then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of different
            styles and influences.
